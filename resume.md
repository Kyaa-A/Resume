# Resume Length Optimization Guide

## One-Page Resume Tips for Students

### Space-Saving Strategies

1. **Combine Similar Sections**
   - Merge "Awards" and "Leadership" into "Leadership & Activities"
   - Combine "Certifications" with "Skills" if space is tight

2. **Prioritize Content**
   - Remove high school info once in college
   - Keep only 3-4 most impressive projects
   - Limit work experience to 2-3 most relevant positions
   - Include only major-relevant coursework

3. **Formatting Tricks**
   - Use 0.5" margins (minimum)
   - Single space with 0pt spacing after paragraphs
   - Use bullet points, not paragraphs
   - Combine contact info on one line

4. **Content Condensing**
   - Use strong action verbs
   - Quantify achievements (save 5 words by saying "increased by 40%" vs "significantly improved performance")
   - Remove "References available upon request"
   - Eliminate personal pronouns (I, my, me)

### When to Go to Two Pages

Only consider 2 pages if you have:
- Multiple internships (3+)
- Significant research publications
- Extensive leadership roles
- 5+ years of experience

### ATS Optimization for One Page

- Keep formatting simple
- Use standard section headers
- Avoid headers/footers
- Save as PDF for humans, .docx for ATS systems
